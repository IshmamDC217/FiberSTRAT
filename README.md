# Stratocaster 3D Model

This project is a simple experimental project created to try out the React Three Fiber library and the Drei package. It renders a 3D model of a Fender Stratocaster guitar, loaded from a GLB file, using the OrbitControls and Environment components. The project also includes text descriptions using the Text component.

## How to run the project

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the project.

That's it! You should now be able to see the 3D model of the Stratocaster guitar along with its description. Feel free to play around with the camera using the OrbitControls component.
