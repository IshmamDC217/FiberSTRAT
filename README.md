# Stratocaster 3D Model

The Fender Stratocaster is renowned as an iconic instrument, particularly beloved by guitarists. As someone who has personally owned and cherished three Stratocasters, I felt compelled to pay homage to this legendary guitar. Thus, I embarked on a modest experimental project aimed at exploring the capabilities of the React Three Fiber library in conjunction with the Drei package. The outcome? A captivating visualization of a Fender Stratocaster in a 3D model format, seamlessly imported from a GLB file. Leveraging the OrbitControls and Environment components, the project offers an immersive experience, allowing users to interact with the virtual guitar. To enhance the presentation further, I incorporated descriptive text using the Text component, providing additional context and details about this timeless instrument.

## How to run the project

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Install the dependencies by running the following command:
